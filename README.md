# React useEffect Hook

This repository contains examples and experiments with the useEffect hook in React.

## Introduction

The useEffect hook is a built-in hook in React that allows you to perform side effects in functional components. It is similar to the lifecycle methods in class components, such as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm start`

## Examples

The repository includes several examples that demonstrate different use cases of the useEffect hook. Each example is located in its own directory and includes a README.md file with detailed instructions.

- [Example 1: Fetching Data](./examples/fetching-data)
- [Example 2: Subscribing to Events](./examples/event-subscription)
- [Example 3: Cleaning Up](./examples/cleanup)
